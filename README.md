# Yireo Webp2ForHyva
## Additional module for Yireo Webp2 and Hyva GraphQL

**If you are using the latest version of
[Yireo_Webp2](https://github.com/yireo/Yireo_Webp2), you do NOT need a
compatibility module of Hyvä and you do NOT need this module. Just
install the extension by following its instructions to install the WebP
module and underlying NextGenImages module.**

This module adds an additional `url_webp` field to the GraphQL query
endpoint for the specific event name
`hyva_graphql_render_before_slider_products_query`.
In current Hyvä versions, this is not needed anymore.
